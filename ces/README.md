CES.js
==============

CES.js is a lightweight Component-Entity-System framework for JavaScript games.


Basic Usage
-----------


To define a new component, simply extend `CES.Component`. 
Note that each component should have a unique `name` property.

```js
var Position = CES.Component.extend({
    name: 'position',
    init: function (x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
});

var Velocity = CES.Component.extend({
    name: 'velocity',
    init: function (x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
});

var Health = CES.Component.extend({
    name: 'health',
    init: function (maxHealth) {
        this.health = this.maxHealth = maxHealth;
    },
    isDead: function () {
        return this.health <= 0;
    },
    receiveDamage: function (damage) {
        this.health -= damage;
    }
});
```

An entity is essentially a container of one or more components.

```js
var hero = new CES.Entity();
hero.addComponent(new Position(0, 0));
hero.addComponent(new Velocity(0, 0));
hero.addComponent(new Health(100));
```

The system is responsible for updating the entities.
In a real game there may be a lot of systems, like `CollisionSystem`,
`RenderSystem`, `ControlSystem` etc.

```js
var PhysicSystem = CES.System.extend({
    update: function (dt) {
        var nodes, entities, position, velocity;

        entities = this.world.getEntities('position', 'velocity');

        entities.forEach(function (entity) {
            position = entity.getComponent('position');
            velocity = entity.getComponent('velocity');
            position.x += velocity.x * dt;
            position.y += velocity.y * dt;
        });
    }
});
```

The world is the container of all the entities and systems.
Calling the `update` method will *sequentially* update all the systems,
in the order they were added.

```js
var world = new CES.World();

world.addEntity(hero);
// ... add other entities

world.addSystem(new PhysicSystem());
// ... add other systems

requestAnimationFrame(function () {
    world.update(/* interval */);
})
```

Installation (Browser)
-------

Download the [minified js file](http://github.com/qiao/ces.js/raw/master/dist/ces-browser.min.js) and include it in your web page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./ces-browser.min.js"></script>
```

Now skip to the `Basic Usage` section of this readme.

Installation (Node.js)
------

If you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.

```bash
npm install ces
```

Then, in your program:

```javascript
var CES = require('ces');
```


Development
------------

Layout:

    .
    |-- dist         # browser distribution
    |-- src          # source code
    `-- test         # test scripts

You will need to install `node.js` and use `npm` to install the dependencies: 

    npm install -d 

To build the browser distribution 
(It will use [node-browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to generate a browser distribution,
and use [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to compress):

    make

To run the tests with
[mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) 

    make test
